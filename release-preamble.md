# Releases

For binary releases, see <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases>.

[`pandoc-announce`](http://groups.google.com/group/pandoc-announce), a
low-volume mailing list that is just for announcements of new releases.

Note that pandoc uses the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy][PVP].
Version numbers should be understood as EPOCH.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH,
rather than as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH as in the more common
Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
